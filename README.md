ArrayDefinitionAndUsage

This project introduces arrays in C#, explaining how to define, initialize, and perform basic operations on arrays. Arrays are useful for storing multiple values of the same type in a single variable. This project demonstrates various ways to use arrays effectively.
Project Structure

The Program.cs file includes examples of:

    Array Declaration and Initialization: Creating and initializing arrays with different data types.
    Accessing Array Elements: Printing each element of an array.
    Reversing an Array: Using the Array.Reverse method to reverse the elements of an array.
    Summing Array Elements: Calculating the sum of integer elements in an array using a loop.

Code Examples

In this project, we cover:

    Defining and initializing an integer array and a string array.
    Accessing array elements with a for loop and a foreach loop.
    Reversing an array and displaying the result.
    Calculating the sum of the elements in an integer array.

Example Output

    Array elements:
    1 2 3 4 5

    Names array elements:
    Alice
    Bob
    Charlie

    Reversed numbers array:
    5 4 3 2 1

    Sum of numbers array: 15

How to Run

    Clone the repository.
    Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
    Run the Program.cs file to see the examples of array usage.

Purpose

This project is aimed at beginners who want to understand how to work with arrays in C#, including how to define, access, and manipulate array data.
